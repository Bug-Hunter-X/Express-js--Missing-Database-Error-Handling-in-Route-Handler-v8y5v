# Express.js: Missing Database Error Handling
This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database queries within route handlers.  Failure to handle database errors properly can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that fetches user data. If a user is not found, it correctly sends a 404 response. However, it lacks error handling for database query failures.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle these errors using try...catch blocks.

This repository highlights the importance of robust error handling in Express.js applications to ensure stability and reliability.
